      Nestled in the remote Himalayas, Mount Kailash is considered one of the holiest places on Earth.

Jains and Bon followers also regard it as a center of cosmic energy and liberation.

      Towering at an altitude of 6,638 meters (21,778 feet), Mount Kailash remains unclimbed due to its sacred status. Pilgrims undertake the Kora (Parikrama), a 52-km circumambulation of the mountain, which is believed to cleanse one’s soul and bring spiritual enlightenment.
      
      The rugged paths of the Kailash Yatra challenge both the body and spirit, making it one of the most revered pilgrimages in the world. The sacred mountain has been a site of worship for thousands of years, drawing seekers from all faiths in pursuit of divine blessings.
